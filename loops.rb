#Their are 10 cases and types of loop statements
# 1. while loop
# 2. Until loop
# 3. for loop

# 6. upto/downto loops
# 7. loop(infinite) or loop with break
# 8. step loop 
# 9. nested loops
# 10. loop control

# When to Use Which:
# Use each for collections (most Ruby-like)

# Use times for fixed iterations

# Use while/until for conditional looping

# Use for when coming from other languages

# Use step for custom increments
